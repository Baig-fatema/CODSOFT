# Codsoft Internship Projects Repository
Welcome to the Codsoft Internship Projects repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of simple but useful applications that I developed during my internship at Codsoft. These applications are designed to showcase my basic python programming skills and are perfect for beginners looking to learn and improve their coding abilities.

# Todo List
Description: The Todo List application is a tkinter gui application. Users can add tasks, cross and uncross out tasks, and remove tasks from the list. It's a great way to practice fundamental data structures and control flow in programming.

Usage: To use the Todo List application, simply run the <main.py> file in your command line. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, view, and manage your tasks.
